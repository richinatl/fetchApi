# fetchApi

## Description

Working with the geocode api, the idea was to create a function that made an asynchronous api call and returned a longitude and lattitude. Originally I had thought I'd expand this idea and build a whole project around it, but the api call limitations of geocode on their free side isn't making it very viable. I left the html and css boiler plate in the project in case I change my mind, I might revisit this one later if I have time. There are a lot of ways the data they return could be used. I'll just have to decide if any of those makes it worth purchasing an api key to build a project around it.
